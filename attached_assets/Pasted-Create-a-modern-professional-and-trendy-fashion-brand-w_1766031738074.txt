Create a modern, professional, and trendy fashion brand website for "Bigwise Clothings".  
The brand name and website name should be "Bigwise".  

Design & Theme:
- Deep purple primary color palette with white text.  
- Gradient transitions: deep purple → lighter purple/blue across sections for a professional layered vibe.  
- Smooth, elegant animations: fade-ins, hover zooms, parallax scroll, section transitions.  
- Typography: bold, modern sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins).  

Pages (minimum 5–6):
1. Home — Hero banner with brand name "Bigwise", tagline, featured collections, Instagram feed preview, trending items, testimonials, newsletter signup.  
2. About — Brand story, mission, values, locations (Ile-Ife and Lagos, Nigeria), with animated timeline or milestones.  
3. Collections — Grid layout showcasing clothing items with hover animations.  
4. Item Detail Page — Each product should have price, description, size, material, wishlist option, and contact buttons (Direct message on site, WhatsApp, Call).  
5. Cart — Viewable cart with items, quantities, and checkout preview.  
6. Contact — Contact form (name, email, message), embedded map showing Ile-Ife and Lagos locations, WhatsApp CTA button, phone number.  
7. Optional Blog/News — Fashion updates, trends, announcements.  

Features:
- Instagram feed section: dynamically show latest IG posts (grid or carousel).  
- Wishlist functionality for users to save favorite items.

Technical:

- Ensure animations are smooth and professional (Framer Motion or CSS transitions).  
- Code should be clean and easy to deploy on Vercel.  
- No backend required — static preview only, but structure should allow future backend integration.
