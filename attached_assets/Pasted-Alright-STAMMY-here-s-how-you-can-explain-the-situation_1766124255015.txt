Alright STAMMY — here’s how you can explain the situation to **Replit** so it understands the deployment issue and can auto‑update your code:

### 📝 Message to Replit

**Subject:** Vercel deployment failing due to build script mismatch  

**Body:**

Hi Replit team,  

I’ve been working on my `bigwise` project and deploying it to Vercel. The local build works fine (`npm run build` runs `tsx script/build.ts` and produces `dist/public` for the client and `dist/index.cjs` for the server).  

However, Vercel fails with:  
```
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1
```

This happens because Vercel’s build environment doesn’t recognize `tsx script/build.ts` as a standard build command. It expects something like `vite build` or `tsc`.  

---

### ✅ Proposed Fix

Please update the `package.json` build scripts so Vercel can run them correctly:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:client": "vite build",
  "build:server": "tsc -p tsconfig.json",
  "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
  "dev": "vite"
}
```

- `vite build` → builds the frontend into `dist/public`  
- `tsc` → compiles the backend into `dist/index.cjs`  
- `npm run build` → runs both, so Vercel succeeds  

Also ensure `vercel.json` points to the right outputs:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "server/index.ts", "use": "@vercel/node" },
    { "src": "dist/public/**", "use": "@vercel/static" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "server/index.ts" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "dist/public/$1" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🎯 Expected Outcome
With these changes, Vercel will:
- Run `npm run build` successfully.  
- Serve the frontend from `dist/public`.  
- Handle backend routes via `server/index.ts`.

👉 You can paste this directly into Replit’s “Ask” or “Bug Report” so it knows what’s wrong and can auto‑update your code.  

Do you want me to also draft a **ready‑to‑use `.vercelignore`** file so Replit doesn’t push junk files like `.local/` and `rd` to Vercel? That will make deployments cleaner.
